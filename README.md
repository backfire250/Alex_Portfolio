# Alex_Portfolio
Data science portfolio to showcase my fun DS projects!

# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/backfire250/ds_salary_proj)
**Project Goal**:  I created a tool that will estimate salaries for Data Scientists based on some factors associated with the job: industry, # of competitors, geography, job title, company size, etc.
* Scraped 1,000 job descriptions from Glassdoor using Python and Selenium.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value that companies put on Python, Excel, AWS, and Spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client-facing API using Flask.

# [Project 2: Data Engineering with Uber](https://github.com/backfire250/uber_pipeline)
**Project Goal**:  Collect relevant data from thousands of Uber trips and create a dashboard to visualize my findings.
* Create a data pipeline to automate data cleaning and send cleaned data to a dashboard.
* Store data in Google Cloud and create a virtual machine to perform data cleaning and analysis.
* Collect data from 10,000 Uber trips in New York. 
* Map out data transformations in Lucid Charts.
* Create a simple dashboard in Looker Studio.

# [Project 3: Optimizing Models For Predicting Forest Fires](https://github.com/backfire250/ds_forest_fires)
**Project Goal**:  Predict the extent of fire damage to a forest using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* Aim to determine how specific characteristics in our dataset can be used to accurately predict future forest fire damage
* Use multiple machine learning techniques to predict outcomes based on provided data
* Build regularized and non-linear models in addition to linear models, then evaluate using k-fold cross validation
