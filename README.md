# Ernie_Portfolio
Data science portfolio to showcase my fun DS projects!

# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/backfire250/ds_salary_proj)
**Project Goal**:  Created a tool that estimates data science salaries based on some factors associated with the job: geography, job title, company size, industry, # of competitors etc.
* Scraped 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
